## MQ-3 The analog alcohol sensor:
This is a sensor that seems to detect the vapor process of alcohol when it interacts with the sensor’s electromagnetic current to give a value on how much alcohol was present. Which basically the heated metal oxide part reacts towards the alcohol with it changing the resistance of that circuit to a high degree from the amount of alcohol concentration. 

Now that’s a summary of the sensor, but how, or what did I learn from this? Well with the given information and setting up the contraption I basically first tested the code to see what happens when the sensor is left in the air, and it only measure around 0.20 to 0.30 alcohol detection within the air over time which it proves the code works now the main question how to get a high since of alcohol for the sensor to read?
