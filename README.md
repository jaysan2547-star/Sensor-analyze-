## MQ-3 The analog alcohol sensor:
This is a sensor that seems to detect the vapor process of alcohol when it interacts with the sensor’s electromagnetic current to give a value on how much alcohol was present. Which basically the heated metal oxide part reacts towards the alcohol with it changing the resistance of that circuit to a high degree from the amount of alcohol concentration. 

Now that’s a summary of the sensor, but how, or what did I learn from this? Well with the given information and setting up the contraption I basically first tested the code to see what happens when the sensor is left in the air, and it only measure around 0.20 to 0.30 alcohol detection within the air over time which it proves the code works now the main question how to get a high since of alcohol for the sensor to read?

## Testing: 
The first thing I wanted to test was my breath since humans do breath out alcohol blood with carbon dioxide which from the results boost the value to around 0.45 to 0.57 showing that the sensor can detect some form of alcohol, but I still need it something stronger to get the sensor to print out a over amount of alcohol value greater than 4.0.
Thankfully I was given a simple cologne spray filled with alcohol senses I had used for the sensor to track its value which was definitely successful after spraying my arm with the cologne then putting the sensor up against the fresh sense of alcohol. It was ranked as a very strong sense at level 4 proving that this sensor is able to pick up high levels of alcohol.
